# Checklists
Checklists manager on iOS
This is a simple checklist app that uses a navigation controller, and Tableview controllers to add items. It uses delegation to pass data across views. 
The table view shows a list of things to do. You can mark as complete, and check for more information. 
The navigation controller allows you to buid a hierarchy of screens that lead from one to another.
